## General Information

- Copilot through GitHub is approved for use, however, there are a few things to note about it’s use.

  - Do not use GitHub Copilot with any personally identifiable, confidential or sensitive information, especially protected health information, as it does not meet WashU HIPAA, FERPA nor similar compliance requirements.
  - RIS highly recommends reviewing thoroughly the FAQ at <https://github.com/features/copilot> as it pertains to privacy and responsible AI (ex: potential for insecure code suggestions).
  - Individual billing for this service is not currently required due to the WashU Enterprise Licensing configuration.
  - RIS encourages use of content exclusion options to ensure Copilot won't be able to access or utilize the contents located in those specified paths. Example configuration:

```java
"*":
  - "**/*.cfg"
  - "**/*.conf"
  - "**/*.config"
  - "**/*.csv"
  - "**/.env"
  - "**/*.env.*"
  - "**/*.json"
  - "**/*.Renviron"
  - "**/*.tsv"
  - "**/*.xml"
  - "**/*.yaml"
  - "**/*.yml"
  - "**/*.yml.erb"
  - "**/*.yaml.erb"
```
